# Go Image Scraper
This is a simple image scraper written in Go.

It will take a command line parameter when you execute the application 
and download all the images on that specific website into an images folder in the directory 
you are running the app from.  

For instance, if I want to grab the images from google.com 
I would compile the go app and run.

/.app https://www.google.com 

If properly run, the images on google.com will show up in the images directory located in the directory you ran your app from.
